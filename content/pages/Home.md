I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of
Philosophy](http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/) at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. My work focuses on two (often intersecting) areas of
philosophy -- the History of Modern Philosophy (especially Kant) and the
Philosophy of Mind. Here you'll find links to my
[research]({filename}/pages/Research.md) and
[teaching]({filename}/pages/Teaching.md), as well as the occasional [blog
post](http://colinmclear.net/category/blog).

If you're interested, here's my complete CV: [PDF]({filename}/pdfs/McLearCV.pdf) 
| [HTML]({filename}/extra/McLearCV.html).
