# First Test

This is a test. It needs a footnote.[^04712]. It also need *formatting*. 
There is **bold text**. And there are bulletts:

- note
- note with math $\rightarrow$ $\therefore$ 
- note

And there needs to be another footnote with a citation.[^04810]

[^04810]: Note and citations - @allais2003. 

[^04712]: Note 1. 

Let's see how this works. What about an inline citation (cf. [@brewer2006])?

## Second

This is fancy & and & and & and.
