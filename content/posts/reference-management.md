There are two things I wish I had better habits for in grad
school---note taking, and managing references. I&rsquo;ll touch on them both
here, but I&rsquo;m mainly going to focus on managing references.

I read a lot, and I skim even more. I want a tool that will help me do
three things. First, I want to be able to keep track of what I&rsquo;m
reading, preferably across multiple devices (e.g.Â an ipad and a laptop).
This is easy if you read one thing at a time, and never start reading
anything else until you&rsquo;ve finished the previous item. But I don&rsquo;t work
that way---perhaps the Internet has caused my short attention span. I&rsquo;m
usually reading several things at once, and often circle back around to
one thing after I&rsquo;ve started something else.

Second, I want to be able to keep track of notes concerning what I&rsquo;m
reading. This is easily done in the margins (if you&rsquo;re not working
electronically, as I almost always am) or in a notebook. But these are
data silos. I want something that I can easily get data out of later.

Third, I want to be able to easily cite what I&rsquo;ve read in my writing.
So, I want three things---reading, annotation, and citation management.
