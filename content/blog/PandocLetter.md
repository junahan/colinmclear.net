I had to write a recommendation letter today and thought I'd use it as an excuse
to write up a Pandoc template for Pandoc-LaTeX conversion. It generates a nice
looking letter with letterhead (assuming you have a logo for it). It uses the
[newlfm package]. The template is on github [here]. I got the idea from Matthew
Miller's [post], and [this discussion] on [texblog.org].
