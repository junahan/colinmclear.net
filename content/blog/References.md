There are two things I wish I had better habits for in grad school---note
taking, and managing references. I'll touch on them both here, but I'm mainly
going to focus on managing references. 

I read a lot, and I skim even more. I want a tool that will help me do three
things. First, I want to be able to keep track of what I'm reading, preferably
across multiple devices (e.g. an ipad and a laptop). This is easy if you read
one thing at a time, and never start reading anything else until you've finished
the previous item. But I don't work that way---perhaps the Internet has caused
my short attention span. I'm usually reading several things at once, and often
circle back around to one thing after I've started something else. 

Second, I want to be able to keep track of notes concerning what I'm reading.
This is easily done in the margins (if you're not working electronically, as I
almost always am) or in a notebook. But these are data silos. I want something
that I can easily get data out of later.

Third, I want to be able to easily cite what I've read in my writing. So, I want
three things---reading, annotation, and citation management.
