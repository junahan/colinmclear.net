Tools for writing using a computer fall into two broad camps. On the one side we
have WYSIWIG word processing applications like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and
Google Docs. They allow not only the typing of text but also real-time
formatting and display. These applications are familiar to most, and are the dominant
ones used in higher-ed today. They also tend to be expensive (or available only
to those with institutional affiliation), suffer from issues of feature-bloat
and unnecessary make-overs, and use proprietary non-human-readable file formats. 

In contrast to the WYSIWIG editors stands the text editor. It operates on plain
text, human readable, files. And its main purpose is to parse text in the most
efficient way possible. It does not display a page as it will look when printed.
There are many, many text editors one can choose from them, and the two most
well-known---vim and emacs---are free. 

As far as I can tell there are three main reasons to prefer a text editor over a
word processing application. 

1. Text editors are more efficient at editing text
2. Text editors connect better with other research and writing tools
3. Text editors are easier to love
