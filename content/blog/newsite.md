I've updated the website with (what I hope is) a cleaner look and a bit better
navigation. Thanks go to [DandyDev](https://github.com/DandyDev) for developing
a great [bootstrap theme](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3) for
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com). I'll be continuing to tweak here and
there so apologies if you find broken links or other infelicities.
