I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Philosophy](http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/) at the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln. My work focuses on two (often intersecting) areas
of philosophy -- the History of Modern Philosophy (especially Kant) and
the Philosophy of Mind. Here you&rsquo;ll find links to my [research](content/research.md) and [teaching](content/teaching.md), as
well as the occasional [blogpost](http://colinmclear.net/category/blog).

If you&rsquo;re interested, here&rsquo;s my complete CV: [PDF](/materials/McLearCV.pdf) | [HTML](/materials/McLearCV.html).
