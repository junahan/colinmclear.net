I have broad interests in the history of seventeenth and eighteenth century
European philosophy, though my work to date mostly focuses on Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s
philosophy. I have written on Kant&rsquo;s views concerning the mind, perception,
his theory of human reason and rationality, and the broader metaphysical and
epistemological views with which these ideas are integrated. I&rsquo;m also very
interested in seeing what, if any, connections may be made between Kant&rsquo;s
positions and contemporary research programs in the philosophy of mind and
metaphysics. In particular, I am interested in issues pertaining to the study
of mental content, the nature and significance of self-consciousness,
reasoning and rationality, and animal cognition.
